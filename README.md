# simple-app  

[Italian](it/README.md) | [English](en/README.md)

*Simple applications* (in different programming/markup languages) to create small sites that do not require neither database nor high-performance hosting, but rather have files that a simple user can easily edit.  
  
Useful for: DIYers, those who are learning or site-creators, web-masters, web-designers. For their low-budget customers (when solutions such as Wordpress are excessive or hosting is not enough performing).  

Soon an useful CLI for create app and add page(s) and section(s).
